#Raymond's Professional Portfolio

##Description

This webpage demonstrates how a professional portfolio should appear to businesses looking to hire Coding Bootcamp graduates. I was motivated to work on this because I will be using this in the future to look for work.
Despite how much fun I had making this, I recognize how important it is for people to make their portfolios appleaing to businesses and demonstrate how creative they can be.
